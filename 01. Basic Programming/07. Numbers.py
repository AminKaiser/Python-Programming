In Python, numbers are a built-in data type that can be used to represent numeric values. There are three main types of numbers in Python:

Integers: Integers are whole numbers, such as -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc. In Python 3, integers have no size limit and can be as large as your system's memory allows.

Floats: Floats are real numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, -0.5, 1.0, etc. Floats are stored using a fixed amount of memory, which means that they have a limited precision.

Complex numbers: Complex numbers are numbers with a real part and an imaginary part, such as 1+2j, 2-3j, etc.

Python provides various built-in functions and operators that can be used to perform arithmetic operations with numbers. Here are some examples:
'''

# Addition
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c) # output: 8

# Subtraction
a = 5
b = 3
c = a - b
print(c) # output: 2

# Multiplication
a = 5
b = 3
c = a * b
print(c) # output: 15

# Division
a = 5
b = 3
c = a / b
print(c) # output: 1.6666666666666667

# Exponentiation
a = 2
b = 3
c = a ** b
print(c) # output: 8

# Modulo
a = 5
b = 3
c = a % b
print(c) # output: 2
