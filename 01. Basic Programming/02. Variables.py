In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare variables before using them. 
When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates the variable for you.
However, there are some rules that you should follow when naming variables in Python:

1. Variable names must start with a letter or underscore (_), but not with a number.
2. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
3. Variable names are case sensitive. For example, "myVar" and "myvar" are two different variables.
4. You cannot use reserved keywords as variable names, such as "if," "while," "for," "and," "or," "not," and "else."
5. It's a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful variable names, so it's easy to understand the purpose of the variable.

my_var = 5
myVar = 6
_myvar = 7

1var = 5 # variable name cannot start with a number
my-var = 6 # variable name cannot contain hyphen
if = 7 # variable name cannot be a reserved keyword
