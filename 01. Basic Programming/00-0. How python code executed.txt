Python code is executed by a program called the Python interpreter. The interpreter reads Python code line by line and executes it one line at a time.

Here's how the process works:

1. When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads the code from the script file.

2. The interpreter then compiles the code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that can be executed more quickly.

3. The interpreter then executes the bytecode, one instruction at a time.

4. As the interpreter executes the code, it may encounter errors or exceptions. If this happens, the interpreter will stop executing the code and raise an error message.

5. If the code runs successfully, the interpreter will produce any output specified in the code, such as printed text or generated data.

It's important to note that the Python interpreter is an interactive program, which means you can also use it to run code line by line in a command prompt or terminal window. This is a great way to experiment with Python code and test out different ideas before writing a full script.
