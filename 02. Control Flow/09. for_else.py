'''
The for...else loop in Python is used to execute a block of code 
when the loop has finished iterating over all the items in a sequence. 
The else block will be executed if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a break statement.

Here's the basic syntax of a for...else loop in Python:

'''
# for variable in sequence:
#     # code to be executed inside the loop
#     if condition:
#         # code to be executed if condition is true
#         break
# else:
#     # code to be executed if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a 'break' statement
